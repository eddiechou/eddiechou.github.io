# Project Overview

In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I developed [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) tests to ensurd functionality worked as intended.

Tests ran:

- Certain variables are defined and not empty.
- Menu is hidden by default.
- Toggle menu icon works as intended.
- Initialization data is present.
- Loading of new feed data results in content changes.
